## Description
This is a social media app using full-stack technologies. It has a Twitter-like interface allowing the use to post about themselves and/or their pets. It is unique to the furry loving population.
It uses bcrypt hooks to hash passwords for added security as well as session storage to for verification of individual logged in users. There are several different fun activities on this social media site including but not limited to: Avatar Selection, likes, comments, randomly generated dog images and randomly generated cat facts (using web APIs [random.dog REST API](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/randomdog-rest-api-v302/) and [Meowfacts REST API](https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts)). There is also a mini-game, "Pitbull or Potato" for extra fun.
The database structure can be find in the Models directory in which we make use of of sequelize and jawsDB for our mySQL backend server and live deployment.
